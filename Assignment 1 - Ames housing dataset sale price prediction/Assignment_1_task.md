In this assignment, you will work with the Ames housing dataset to predict house sale prices. Assignment to be done in group of 2.

You will only use the knowledge you acquired through the lectures. You will use the three algorithms mentioned below on the shelf since we have not covered algorithms and their fine tuning yet.

Your main focus with this assignment will be on data preprocessing, visualizing, and feature engineering. You will focus less on accurate prediction or algorithms. 

Please download the dataset online https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset.

Start by exploring, preprocessing, visualizing, and feature engineering of data.

Implement and compare three regression algorithms, "LinearRegression", "PolynomialFeatures", and ensemble regression model (either Gradientboostingregressor or RandomforestRegressor).

Evaluate these models using appropriate accuracy metrics. If accuracy is low, don't worry. Explain your reasoning for data preprocessing and choosing features in the jupyter notebook submission.

Submission: Link of GitHub for code. One document explaining how you worked in a group in no more than 1000 words.
